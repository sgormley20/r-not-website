    <h1>What is PTSD</h1>
    <p class="section-label">Overview</p>
   <p>
  Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event such as an accident, assault, or disaster.
</p>

<p>
  Most people recover naturally, but for some the effects last much longer. Symptoms may include intrusive memories, avoiding reminders, feeling “on edge,” and negative changes in mood or beliefs.
</p>

<p>
  PTSD is a human reaction to overwhelming events - not a sign of weakness - and effective treatments are available.

<p>Stressful experiences are a normal part of life. Unfortunately, severe stress or “traumatic events” are also quite common. Almost everyone will encounter at least one traumatic event during their lifetime.</p>

<p>A traumatic event can be defined as experiencing or witnessing actual or threatened death, serious injury, or unwanted sexual contact.</p>

<p>Examples of such events include car accidents, or violent and sexual assaults.</p>

<p>Each person reacts to a traumatic event in their own way. There are, however, common reactions that many people share.</p>

<p>After a traumatic event, it's normal to experience overwhelming waves of unpleasant thoughts and feelings. These reactions happen because our bodies are flooded with stress hormones to help us face or escape danger.</p>

<p>This is sometimes called the "fight or flight" response.</p>

<p>Usually, the body recovers from this stress, and those unpleasant thoughts, feelings and physical symptoms decrease over time.</p>

<p>However, for some people, the effects of a traumatic event can last long after the danger has passed.</p>

<p>Their symptoms might include sudden, unpleasant memories of the event, avoiding reminders of the event, feeling jumpy or "on edge", and changes in the way they think about the world, themselves, the future, and other people.</p>

<p>People’s bodies also respond to these symptoms. When someone experiences a sudden and unpleasant thought, it can cause their heart to start beating faster, their breathing might become rapid and shallow, their chest might tighten, and they can start to sweat and feel nauseous.</p>

<p>If these symptoms last for more than a month, and cause significant distress and difficulty in daily life, the person might be suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, or PTSD.</p>

<p>More information about PTSD is provided in your R-NOT booklet. Please take your time to read it when you can.</p>

<p>It’s important to know that anyone can develop symptoms of PTSD, no matter their background or experiences. It’s not a sign of weakness. It’s a very human reaction to overwhelming circumstances and stress.</p>

<p>Without treatment, PTSD symptoms can last for many months, or even years.</p>

<p>These symptoms can have negative knock-on effects on someone’s life, causing low mood and withdrawal from friends and family. Self-care and work might become harder. Unhelpful behaviours, like drinking too much alcohol or drug use, might also develop.</p>

<p>The good news is that there are several well-established and effective treatments for PTSD.</p>

<p>These include different types of talking therapies, which are known as “first-line” treatments. That means they’re usually tried first, because they help most people and have relatively few side effects.</p>

<p>Examples of talking therapies for PTSD include cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).</p>

<p>Other established treatments include medications, such as sertraline and paroxetine.</p>

<p>There are also a number of newer treatments being explored for PTSD. These newer options might be helpful, although they haven't yet gone through all the scientific testing needed before they can be widely recommended.</p>

<p>Although both existing and new treatments are crucial for helping people reclaim their lives, they are usually resource-intensive, and the benefits tend to appear gradually. It often takes several weeks before symptoms are expected to start improving with current therapies.</p>

<p>Our team has decades of clinical and research experience with PTSD and we’re dedicated to finding better ways to support people living with it.</p>

<p>R-NOT, the treatment we’re developing in this project, is still in the early stages of research. Before we can test it in a large-scale clinical trial, we’re carrying out smaller studies to check whether it’s effective, and whether people find it to be an acceptable treatment.</p>

<p>We’re very grateful for your decision to be part of our research. Your involvement is helping us make real progress. Thank you.</p>

<p>If you would like to ask any questions or find out more about PTSD or the R-NOT treatment, please feel free to speak to the research team at University College London.</p>
