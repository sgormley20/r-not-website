    <p class="section-label">Overview</p>
   <p>
  In PTSD, certain memories of the traumatic event do not fade in the same way that ordinary unpleasant memories do.
</p>

<p>
  These vivid, unwanted memories, called intrusive memories, can appear suddenly or be triggered by sights, sounds, or smells.
</p>

<p>
  Even though they may only last a moment, intrusive memories can feel intense and distressing.

<p>Typically, our memories of an unpleasant event fade with time. The event comes to mind less and less often and becomes less vivid in our mind’s eye.</p>

<p>Eventually, we might even forget the event altogether.</p>

<p>In PTSD, however, this ordinary forgetting does not seem to happen. Instead, memories of the traumatic event can persist for a very long time. That is why people with PTSD continue to vividly remember certain aspects of the event, even long after it happened, and why the memory can come to mind so easily, even when they try hard to block it out.</p>

<p>These unwanted, distressing memories that suddenly pop into your mind are called intrusive memories.</p>

<p>Sometimes, intrusive memories seem to appear out of the blue. Other times, they might be triggered by something you see or hear, for example a particular scene in a movie or a sudden loud sound.</p>

<p>Intrusive memories are different from everyday thoughts, ideas, or memories. Usually, intrusive traumatic memories appear as a brief image that flashes into the mind like a photograph, or a short movie clip of the traumatic event.</p>

<p>In other words, they are typically visual mental images.</p>

<p>For some people, intrusive memories might involve other senses too, like hearing a sound or smelling a particular smell linked to the event.</p>

<p>Even though intrusive memories may only last a moment, they can have a very strong emotional impact.</p>

<p>So, what is the relevance of intrusive memories to our research on R-NOT?</p>

<p>R-NOT stands for Retrieval-dependent Nitrous Oxide Therapy, a new approach we are exploring that combines memory recall with the use of nitrous oxide, which is also known as “gas and air”.</p>

<p>The word "retrieval" here refers to retrieving, or recalling, memories from the long-term memory storage system in your brain. By reminding you of a memory, we are helping you retrieve that memory and bring it online so that it can potentially be worked with in new ways.</p>

<p>Thank you for helping us explore new possibilities for PTSD treatment.</p>

<p>If you would like to ask any questions or find out more about PTSD or the R-NOT treatment, please feel free to speak to the research team at University College London.</p>
