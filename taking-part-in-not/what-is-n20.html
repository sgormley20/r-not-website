    <h1>What is Nitrous Oxide</h1>
    <p class="section-label">Overview</p>

   <p>
  Nitrous oxide, sometimes called "gas and air," is a familiar medical treatment used worldwide as a fast-acting painkiller during procedures such as dental work or childbirth.
</p>

<p>
  It is a short-acting drug with a long safety record. We are testing whether it can also help reduce PTSD symptoms.

<p><strong>What it is</strong></p>
<p>A widely used, fast-acting painkiller.</p>
<p>Belongs to a group of drugs called "dissociative anaesthetics".</p>

<p><strong>How it feels</strong></p>
<p>Can cause mild, short-lived changes in consciousness, including a sense of detachment, also known as dissociation.</p>
<p>Compared to many other consciousness-altering drugs, effects are usually mild.</p>

<p><strong>Individual differences</strong></p>
<p>Responses can vary from person to person, and even within the same person on different occasions.</p>

<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
<p>Has been used safely in medicine for decades when administered correctly in a controlled setting.</p>

<p><strong>Why it is being studied for PTSD</strong></p>
<p>Growing scientific evidence suggests it may reduce symptoms of certain mental health conditions.</p>
<p>We are testing whether nitrous oxide alone, or combined with memory recall, can help people with PTSD.</p>
