<div class="read-more-content">

<p><strong>Step 1 – Online Screening Call</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Conducted via phone or MS Teams, no travel needed</li>
  <li>Lasts about 1.5 hours</li>
  <li>We will ask about your health, medications, PTSD symptoms, and intrusive memories</li>
  <li>Your answers are confidential and secure</li>
  <li>If eligible, you will be invited to the preparation visit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2 – Preparation Visit</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>In-person at UCL, approximately 2 hours</li>
  <li>Helps you get ready for the treatment visit</li>
  <li>Identify memories to focus on during treatment</li>
  <li>Complete baseline questionnaires and medical checks, including height and weight</li>
  <li>Learn how gas and air works and practise grounding techniques if it feels overwhelming</li>
  <li>Only brief summaries of memories are needed, no detailed descriptions</li>
  <li>At the end, we schedule your treatment visit</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3 – Treatment Visit</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>One in-person visit at UCLH, approximately 3.5 hours</li>
  <li>Focuses on your most distressing memory</li>
  <li>Briefly recall the memory, inhale gas and air for one hour, and be monitored before, during, and after</li>
  <li>You have full control over inhalation and can take breaks or stop if needed</li>
  <li>After inhalation, you rest and recover before leaving</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4 – Monitoring Symptoms at Home</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete a short daily online diary about intrusive memories, including frequency, vividness, and distress</li>
  <li>Wear a smartwatch to measure heart rate and record memories as they occur</li>
  <li>Occasional online questionnaires</li>
  <li>Support is provided to help you complete these tasks</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 5 – Follow-Up Calls</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Conducted 7 and 28 days after your treatment via phone or MS Teams</li>
  <li>We will check your PTSD and mental health symptoms</li>
  <li>Return the smartwatch in a pre-paid envelope</li>
</ul>
