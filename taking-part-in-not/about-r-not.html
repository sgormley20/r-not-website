    <p class="section-label">Overview</p>
<p>
  Retrieval-dependent Nitrous Oxide Therapy (R-NOT) is a new approach our team is testing for PTSD.
</p>

<p>
  It combines two parts, recalling a traumatic memory and inhaling nitrous oxide ("gas and air"), in a controlled medical setting.
</p>

<p>
  We are investigating whether this technique can help reduce distressing, intrusive memories in people with PTSD.

<p>Our team is exploring a new and promising approach to treating PTSD. It involves a familiar medical treatment, nitrous oxide, also known as "gas and air."</p>

<p>This drug is widely used around the world as a fast-acting painkiller, for example during dental work or childbirth.</p>

<p>It is a very safe and short-acting drug that has been part of medical care for decades.</p>

<p>The new treatment we are developing is called Retrieval-dependent Nitrous Oxide Therapy, or R-NOT for short.</p>

<p>It has two key parts: the memory recall, or retrieval part, meaning revisiting a memory, and the nitrous oxide inhalation part.</p>

<p>There is growing scientific evidence that inhaling gas and air, nitrous oxide, in a controlled medical setting might reduce symptoms of certain mental health problems.</p>

<p>We want to find out if this is also true for people with PTSD.</p>

<p>In addition, we want to test whether the effects of gas and air are even stronger if participants recall traumatic memories close to the time they inhale nitrous oxide.</p>

<p>We think that recalling, or retrieving, traumatic intrusive memories around the same time as inhaling gas and air may help promote the forgetting of these distressing memories.</p>

<p><strong>More about Gas and Air (Nitrous Oxide)</strong></p>

<p>Here are some other things you should know about gas and air, or nitrous oxide.</p>

<p>Gas and air, nitrous oxide, belongs to a group of drugs called dissociative anaesthetics.</p>

<p>This means it can cause some consciousness-altering effects, including a feeling called dissociation, a sense of disconnection from reality.</p>

<p>Compared to many other drugs that alter consciousness, the feelings of disconnection caused by gas and air are usually relatively mild.</p>

<p>However, it is important to know that the response to gas and air can vary, both from person to person, and even within the same person on different occasions.</p>

<p>Thank you for being part of this important research. Together, we are making a difference.</p>

<p>If you would like to ask any questions or find out more about PTSD or the R-NOT treatment, please feel free to speak to the research team at University College London.</p>
