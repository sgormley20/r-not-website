    <p>
      The R-NOT study has been shaped with input from people with lived experience of PTSD.
    </p>

    <p>
      Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) has been part of every stage, helping us make the study safe, understandable, and relevant to participants.

  <p><strong>Our Patient Advisory Group</strong></p>
  <p>
    The study has a dedicated Patient Advisory Group made up of people with experience of PTSD.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>They provide insight into what it is like to live with intrusive memories and other PTSD symptoms</li>
    <li>They help ensure that study materials, procedures, and communications are clear and sensitive</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>How PPI has shaped the study</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advising on the study design and treatment procedures</li>
    <li>Reviewing participant information sheets, consent forms, and this website</li>
    <li>Providing guidance on how to make the treatment visits and home monitoring as comfortable as possible</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Why their input matters</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gives the research team a real-world perspective on living with PTSD</li>
    <li>Helps make the study more participant-friendly, safe, and effective</li>
    <li>Ensures the study addresses issues that matter most to people with PTSD</li>
  </ul>
